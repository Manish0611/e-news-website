                        <p>Her shooting hand bruised by repeated pistol recoils during unrelenting training, Manu Bhaker will take a well deserved three month break. But it will be no vacation. The double Olympic medallist will continue her other routines including yoga and waking up at 6 am -- which she hates. And oh yes. She also plans to catch up on her hobbies -- horse riding, skating, Bharatnatyam and violin practice to name a few.

                        <p>
                            India has made significant strides in the field of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology and systems in the recent years owing to various factors like govt policies, investment in research and development, and a highly skilled workforce, said experts on Monday.
VLSI is a process used in design and fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs), which are electronic circuits that are made up of many transistors and other components that are combined into a single chip.
